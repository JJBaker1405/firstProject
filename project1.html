    The Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus is a species
    of cephalopod native to the
    <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/W9CqUC3L8qMWpfsw7" target="_blank">Hood Canal</a>
    in Washington State. It is a tree-dwelling subspecies of
    octopus that lives in the temperate rainforests of the west coast of North
    America. It has adapted to live amphibiously, only migrating to the Hood Canal
    during breeding season, where it finds a mate. Males fertilize the females
    and then leave the females to find an aquatic home for their eggs. Their
    skin has adapted to live in the moist environment of temperate rainforests
    without dessicating and drying out for extended periods of time.</p>
